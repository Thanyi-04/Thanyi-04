Recenlty completed a BSc degree in Mathematics and Computational & Applied Mathematics. I am based in Johannesburg, South Africa. Looking to build projects in data analysis, mathematical and financial modelling. If you are an aspiring data scientist, quant or investment analyst hmu let's collaborate in projects to build our portfolios. In addition I enjoy reading and mastering topics in pure mathematics specifically Real and Functional analysis, a strange hobby I know but what is the point of advanced mathematics if you cannot have fun with it? Let's use mathematics for good and enjoy it while we're at it.😄
